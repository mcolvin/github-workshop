The 3 bullets below are usually where I put people in my lab to get a bit of background.

* [Getting started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en)
* [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/)
* [What is GitHub, an introduction](https://www.muo.com/what-is-github-an-introduction/)

I can't vouch for any of these, but they look cool and keep in mind 
there are lots more content out there beyond this on the line.
